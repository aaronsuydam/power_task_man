# PowerTaskMan
Welcom to the PowerTaskMan repository! This is just a hobby project of  mine to gain a little more control over performance reporting and task management in Windows. The goal is to be friendly to power uses with extensibility in mind, including the ability to drill down into performance stats to your heart's content. The project is still in its early stages, but I hope to add more features and functionality over time.

PRs are welcome, for right now, this is a personal, pre-alpha project, so Iif you file an issue, please file a PR that also fixes it.
